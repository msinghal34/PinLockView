# PinLockView
A clean, minimalistic, easy-to-use and highly customizable pin lock custom view for Android.

![PinLockView](screens/logo.png)

This library allows you to implement a pin lock mechanism in your app **easily and quickly**. There are **plenty of customization options** available to change the look-and-feel of this view to match your app's theme.

You can also use it as a dial pad to dial numbers. There are several other use cases of this library and is not restricted to only pin locking.

## Usage

### Gradle
Top level build file:
``` gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    	maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
In your application build file:
``` gradle
implementation 'com.github.msinghal34:pinlockview:3.2.0'
```

### XML

Place the view in your XML layout file.

```xml
<com.msinghal34.pinlockview.PinLockView
    android:id="@+id/pin_lock_view"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

### Java
Reference the view in code and add a listener to it.

```java
mPinLockView = (PinLockView) findViewById(R.id.pin_lock_view);
mPinLockView.setPinLockListener(mPinLockListener);
private PinLockListener mPinLockListener = new PinLockListener() {
    @Override
    public Boolean onComplete(String pin) {
        Log.d(TAG, "Pin complete: " + pin);
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void onEmpty() {
        Log.d(TAG, "Pin empty");
    }

    @Override
    public void onPinChange(int pinLength, String intermediatePin) {
        Log.d(TAG, "Pin changed, new length " + pinLength + " with intermediate pin " + intermediatePin);
    }
};
```

### Kotlin
Reference the view in code and add a listener to it.

```java
val mPinLockView = findViewById<PinLockView>(R.id.pin_lock_view)
mPinLockView.setPinLockListener(object : PinLockListener {
    override fun onComplete(pin: String?): Boolean {
        Timber.i("Pin entered: $pin")
        return true
    }

    override fun onEmpty() {
        Timber.i("Pin empty")
    }

    override fun onPinChange(pinLength: Int, intermediatePin: String?) {
        Timber.i("Pin changed, new length: $pinLength with intermediate pin: $intermediatePin")
    }
})
```

And that's it! Your PinLockView is ready to rock.

But the good thing is that the ```PinLockView``` comes with a whole lot of customization options which you can use to customize the view in any way you want.

# Customization

## IndicatorDots (Addon)
PinLockView comes bundled with an addon view, ```IndicatorDots``` which can be optionally attached with the PinLockView to indicate pin changes visually to the user.

This **view has been decoupled from the PinLockView** so that you can optionally add it, if necessary. Suppose you are implementing a dial pad, then you will certainly not need this IndicatorView.

Add the view to you XML layout, generally placed above your PinLockView,

### XML
```xml
 <com.msinghal34.pinlockview.IndicatorDots
        android:id="@+id/indicator_dots"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```
then find a reference to the view and attach it to the parent PinLockView,

### Java
```java
mIndicatorDots = (IndicatorDots) findViewById(R.id.indicator_dots);
mPinLockView.attachIndicatorDots(mIndicatorDots);
```


### Kotlin
```java
val mIndicatorDots = findViewById<IndicatorDots>(R.id.indicator_dots)
mPinLockView.attachIndicatorDots(mIndicatorDots);
```

You **MUST** attach it to the PinLockView, otherwise it will be simply ignored.

## Theming

There are several theming options available through XML attributes which you can use to completely change the look-and-feel of this view to match the theme of your app. The values shown in example are the default ones.

**Customization for PinLock view**
```xml
  app:plv_pinLength="4"                                       // Length of the pin
  app:plv_textColor="#FFFFFF"                                 // Color of the digits and the delete drawable
  app:plv_textSize="24sp"                                     // Font size of digits in the keypad
  app:plv_buttonSize="64dp"                                   // Size of individual keys/buttons
  app:plv_buttonBackgroundColor="#FFFFFF"                     // Keypad buttons' background color. Alpha of 0.2 is applied to color internally
  app:plv_verticalSpacing="12dp"                              // Vertical space between the keypad buttons
  app:plv_horizontalSpacing="32dp"                            // Horizontal space between the keypad buttons
  app:plv_vibrate="true"                                      // Whether to vibrate on key press and success/error events
  app:plv_showDeleteButton="true"                             // Whether to show the delete button or not
  app:plv_deleteButtonDrawable="@drawable/ic_delete"          // Customize drawable for the delete button
  app:plv_deleteButtonSize="48dp"                             // Size of the delete button drawable in the keypad
  app:plv_showButtonPressAnimation="true"                     // Whether to show animation on pressing keypad button or not
```


**Customization for Indicator Dots**
```xml
  app:id_emptyDotDrawable="@drawable/dot_empty"                // Customize the empty dot drawable
  app:id_filledDotDrawable="@drawable/dot_filled"              // Customize the filled dot drawable
  app:id_dotDiameter="14dp"                                    // Diameter of the dots
  app:id_dotMargin="12dp"                                      // Margin between dots
  app:id_dotColor="#FFFFFF"                                    // Color of filled and empty dots, only applicable if custom drawables for dots are not provided
  app:id_indicatorType="fixed"                                 // Available options: "fixed", "fill" and "fillWithAnimation"
```
